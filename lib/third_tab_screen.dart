I have always believed that technology has tremeandous power to advance human understanding. My enthusiasm for computer engineering grew as I explored web technology and ultimately cross-platform mobile development. I pivoted from teaching to full-time development in 2017, becoming the lead developer for the International Cloud Appreciation Society. I have developed Flutter, Angular, and Vue frontends, worked with numberous Firebase and AWS back-end technologies, and delivered and maintained live apps to the Apple App Store and Google Play.",
